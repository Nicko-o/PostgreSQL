-- The Lilmon table contains information about the different lilmons that players can collect.
-- 'id' is the id of the lilmon.
-- 'name' is the name of the lilmon.
-- 'element1' is the primary element of the lilmon.
-- 'element2' is the secondary element of the lilmon if they have one, NULL otherwise.
-- 'rarity' is the designated rarity of the lilmon.
-- Read the constraints below for more details on what values these columns can take on.
CREATE TABLE Lilmon(

-- The Player table contains information about the players of the game.
-- 'id' is the id of the player.
-- 'playername' is the chosen playername of the player.
-- 'email' is the email of the player.
-- 'country_code' is the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code of the country that the player is in. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3 for more details.
-- 'coins' is the number of coins the player currently has. You can assume this is always >= 0.
-- 'rolls' is the number of times the player has spent coins to acquire a random lilmon. You can assume this is always >= 0.
-- 'wins' is the number of times the player has won a completed battle. You can assume this is always >= 0.
-- 'losses' is the number of times the player has lost a completed battle. You can assume this is always >= 0.
-- 'total_battles' is the number of times the player has participated in a (not necessarily completed) battle. You can assume this is always >= 0. The reason why wins plus losses is not necessarily equal to total_battles is that there may be some unforeseen circumstances that lead to a battle not being completed (eg: server or connection issues).
-- 'guild' is the id of the guild that the player belongs to (whether they are member or a leader) if they belong to one, NULL otherwise. A player can only belong to at most one guild. The constraint on this column can be found after the definition of the Guild table.

-- The Guild table contains information about a guild.
-- A guild must contain at least one member (namely, the guild leader) and a player can be in at most one guild (as previously mentioned in the Player table).
-- Hence, guild membership is tracked in the Player table.
-- 'id' is the id of the guild.

-- The LilmonInventory table contains information about lilmons that players have collected.
-- 'id' is the unique id of the collected lilmon. This is because a player can collect multiple of the same lilmon and so this is to help distinguish between them.
-- 'l_id' is the id of the lilmon.
-- 'p_id' is the id of the player.
-- 'in_team' is a flag that indicates whether this specific lilmon is currently active in the player's team. You may assume a player can only have up to five (5) lilmons in their team at any given time.
-- 'fav' is a flag that indicates whether the player has favourited this specific lilmon.
